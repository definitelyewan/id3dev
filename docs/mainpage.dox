ID3dev is a versatile library crafted to manage various ID3 versions and standards, encompassing ID3v1, ID3v1.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, and ID3v2.4. 
Its objective is to integrate all features outlined in the documentation of each version while upholding adaptability. Moreover, ID3dev provides 
comprehensive programmability, empowering users to introduce custom frames via contexts. This adaptability extends to ID3dev's capacity to 
generate binary tags, produce JSON output, and efficiently parse data. While this library can be compiled via GCC, Clang, and MinGW, MSCV has not 
been fully tested and is not guaranteed to work. The modules LinkedListLib, HashTableLib, and ByteStream are essential for proper functionality 
and have been tailored specifically for this project. Additionally, cmocka, valgrind (WSL, Linux) or leak (Mac OS) are necessary for tests to 
compile and function accurately.
