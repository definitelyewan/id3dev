# ID3dev
ID3dev is a library crafted to support all versions of the ID3 standard including ID3v1, ID3v1.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, and ID3v2.4. It is versatile and programmable allowing users to generate custom metadata that better suits their needs.

## What Can It Do?
ID3dev is capable of reading, manipulating, converting, and outputting all supported frames found within the ID3v2.x specifications with only a couple of exceptions when it comes to features (see below table). Additionally, it supports all previously mentioned features for ID3v1.x with the ability to dynamically switch between ID3v2.x and ID3v1.x standards.

### Frame Support
Keep in mind that not all frames are supported in every version.
‚úÖ = full support, üü° = partial support, ‚ùå = no support.

## Cloning
ID3dev utilizes four distinct C libraries to operate. These libraries include LinkedListLib, HashTableLib, ByteStream, and cmocka. ByteStream is essential for handling binary data and converting it into C data types. LinkedListLib facilitates the addition of a generic doubly linked list, while HashTableLib enables the addition of a generic dynamic hash table. The sole optional library is cmocka, which is exclusively necessary for testing purposes and can be disregarded otherwise.

To download this project and all of it's dependencies run :
```bash
git clone git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/definitelyewan/id3dev.git
```

## Building
This project comes with a Python3 script intended to be used to build it. This script is located at `./scripts/build.py` and should be run from the root directory of this project. However, if you wish to build this project via standard cmake to gain access to extra build options you can. 
build options:
- `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` can be toggled on for a shared library and off for a static one
- `BUILD_ID3_DOCS` can be toggled to generate documentation
- `BUILD_ID3_TESTS` can be toggled to generate unit tests
- `DEDUB_ID3_SYMBOLS` can be toggled to include or not include debug symbols
- `BUILD_ID3_C_EXAMPLES` can  be toggled to create example C programs

To build ID3dev with these options you will need to use CMake along with the below commands (OS dependant).
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cd build
$ make
``` 

## Installing
> Ensure all commands are run from the root of the cloned project directory.
> The below commands assume you built ID3dev via the `build.py` file described in the above section
### Linux Systems
To install this library system wide you can do the following:
```bash
cp ./build/modules/HashTableLib/libHashTableLib.so /usr/lib
cp ./build/modules/LinkedListLib/libLinkedList.so /usr/lib
cp ./build/modules/ByteStream/libByteStream.so /usr/lib
cp ./build/libid3dev.so /usr/lib
```
```bash
cp -r ./include/* /usr/include/
cp ./modules/ByteStream/include/* /usr/include/
cp ./modules/HashTableLib/include/* /usr/include/
cp ./modules/LinkedListLib/include/* /usr/include/
```

### Mac Systems
To install this library system wide you can do the following:
```bash
cp ./build/modules/HashTableLib/libHashTableLib.dylib /usr/lib
cp ./build/modules/LinkedListLib/libLinkedList.dylib /usr/lib
cp ./build/modules/ByteStream/libByteStream.dylib /usr/lib
cp ./build/libid3dev.dylib /usr/lib
```
```bash
cp -r ./include/* /usr/include/
cp ./modules/ByteStream/include/* /usr/include/
cp ./modules/HashTableLib/include/* /usr/include/
cp ./modules/LinkedListLib/include/* /usr/include/
```

### Windows Systems
Instead of installing ID3dev system wide on Windows its recommended that you just install it along side a single project.
```powershell
Copy-Item -Path .\build\modules\HashTableLib\libHashTableLib.dylib -Destination "your project dir"
Copy-Item -Path .\build\modules\LinkedListLib\libLinkedList.dylib -Destination "your project dir"
Copy-Item -Path .\build\modules\ByteStream\libByteStream.dylib -Destination "your project dir" 
Copy-Item -Path .\build\libid3dev.dylib -Destination "your project dir"
```
```powershell
Copy-Item -Path .\include\* -Destination "your project dir" -Recurse
Copy-Item -Path .\modules\ByteStream\include\* -Destination "your project dir"
Copy-Item -Path .\modules\HashTableLib\include\* -Destination "your project dir"
Copy-Item -Path .\modules\LinkedListLib\include\* -Destination "your project dir"
```
## Usage
Depending on the feature set you wish to use you may want to include different headers
- `id3v1.h` contains functions exclusive to ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 tags
- `id3v2.h` contains functions exclusive to ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, and ID3v2.4
- `id3dev.h` contains functions for editing any tag version


```C
#include <id3dev.h>
// #include <id3v1/id3v1.h> only ID3v1.x
// #include <id3v2/id3v2.h> only ID3v2.x

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    // code

    return 0;
}

```

## Documentation
ID3dev is fully documented! all documentation can be viewed online via Github Pages at https://definitelyewan.github.io/id3dev/ . Alternativly, it can be built from source for offline use with the below command `python3 ./scripts/docs.py` and opened in any web browser from the build folder however, you may want to move it.

### Standards
ID3 source documentation is included with this project and located in `docs/` in a text and html format. 

### Doxygen
Full ID3dev function documenation is located online at https://definitelyewan.github.io/id3dev/ or can be built form source via `python3 ./scripts/docs.py`

### Examples
A couple examples on how to use this project are located in the `example` folder and can be built using `python3 ./scripts/examples`

### Tests
There are well over 100 test cases located in the test folder for proof of functionallity. to build and run these tests cmocka must be installed on your system for `python3 ./scripts/test.py`.
